# Scripts reference

## Overview

`scripts/` contains all CLI entry points, core maintenance scripts, sandbox provisioning, and shared library functions. Entry points delegate to subcommands. Lib functions are sourced, never executed directly.

## Core scripts

| Script        | `bun run`  | What it does                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verify.sh`   | `check`    | Runs format, format check, spell check, shell check in sequence                                |
| `update.sh`   | `update`   | Interactive dep update via `bun update --interactive`, then verify                             |
| `clean.sh`    | `clean`    | Wipes `node_modules/`, clears bun cache, reinstalls from lockfile                              |
| `snapshot.sh` | `snapshot` | Writes project file tree to `.claude/.tmp/project/PROJECT-SNAPSHOT.md` for Claude chat context |

## manage-sync.sh

`aitk sync [target]` runs all installed domain syncs in sequence (standards, snippets, prompts, governance, antigravity), then runs a git workflow step. The git workflow detects which domains changed, shows a preview of the commit and PR body, prompts for confirmation, then stages everything, commits with `chore(sync): update <domains> from toolkit`, creates `chore/toolkit-sync`, pushes, and opens a PR via `gh`. The PR body lists up to three changed filenames per domain, then a count for the rest.

If `.claude/GOV.md` exists in the target after governance sync, it is regenerated automatically by calling `manage-claude.sh gov` with `AITK_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`.

The git workflow step is skipped if the target is not a git root (no `.git/`), `gh` is not installed, or `chore/toolkit-sync` already exists locally or on the remote.

## lib

**`ui.sh`**: source this in any script that needs terminal output. Provides the color palette, all `log_*` functions, interactive prompts (`select_option`, `ask`), `guard_root` (rejects toolkit root as a target), and `require_project_root`.

**`inject.sh`**: tooling injection helpers used by `tooling/sync.sh` and sandbox scripts. The key distinction: configs always overwrite, seeds merge-only. `inject_tooling_manifest` is the orchestrator. It ties together missing dep installation, script injection, and gitignore merging in one call.

**`gov.sh`**: sourced by both `gov/build.sh` and `claude/prompt.sh`. Contains `build_rules_payload`, which strips frontmatter and concatenates `.mdc` files into a temp file. Accepts an optional space-separated filter of rule names. When provided, only those rules are included. Both consumers call the same function. Don't duplicate this logic if adding a third.
