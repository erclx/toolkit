# Prompt System

## Overview

The prompt system generates master prompts by injecting installed governance rules into a template. Two templates exist: one for the Gemini CLI (agentic, runs tools directly) and one for chat interfaces (generates structured output a human pastes and applies). The output is a ghost file, gitignored and never committed.

## Structure

````
scripts/
├── manage-prompts.sh               ← entry point (gdev prompt)
        └── templates/
            └── master-prompt-chat.template ← for chat interface sessions```

Output writes to the target project at runtime:

````

.gemini/.tmp/
└── master-prompt.md ← generated, gitignored, never committed

````

## Key Decisions

**Rules come from the target project, not the toolkit.** `gdev prompt` reads `.cursor/rules/` in the current working directory. Run `gdev gov rules` in the target project first to install the relevant rule set before generating a prompt.

**A single template serves the chat workflow.** The `master-prompt-chat.template` assumes a human is the executor, structuring output as `# PLAN / # FILES / # VERIFY` blocks intended to be pasted into `apply.toml` for file application.

**Governance injection is identical across both templates.** Frontmatter is stripped from each `.mdc` file, rules are concatenated with separators, and the payload is injected at `{{GOVERNANCE_RULES}}`. The template type only changes the surrounding instructions.

**Output is ephemeral.** `.gemini/.tmp/` is gitignored. The master prompt is regenerated per session, reflects whatever rules are currently installed, and can be edited mid-session without affecting the source rules.

## CLI

| Command                | What it does                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `gdev prompt`          | Generates a master prompt using the chat template    |
| `gdev prompt generate` | Same as `gdev prompt`                                |

`gdev prompt` lists installed rules, prompts for template type, then asks for confirmation before generating.

## Workflow

Typical session setup:

```bash
gdev gov rules          # install rules for detected stack
gdev prompt             # pick cli or chat, confirm, generate
````

For chat sessions, copy `.gemini/.tmp/master-prompt.md` as the system prompt in your chat interface. After the model responds with `# PLAN / # FILES / # VERIFY` blocks, apply the output with:

```bash
gemini dev:apply "<paste response>"
```

## Adding or Changing Templates

Templates live in `scripts/templates/`. Each must contain the `{{GOVERNANCE_RULES}}` placeholder at the line where injected rules should appear. Everything above that line is the header, everything below is the footer. No other syntax is required.

## Notes

- Run `gdev gov rules` before `gdev prompt` when switching projects or stacks
- The generated prompt includes raw rule content, so review it before a sensitive session
- Add `.gemini/.tmp/` to `.gitignore` if missing
