## Setup

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/toolkit/claude
```

Add to your shell config to load automatically:

```bash
alias claude='claude --plugin-dir /path/to/toolkit/claude'
```

## Plugin skills

Plugin skills live in `claude/skills/` and are auto-discovered when Claude Code loads with `--plugin-dir`. No registration needed, folder presence is enough. Each skill is a kebab-case folder containing `SKILL.md`.

| Skill               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude-feature`    | Plan a feature by reading Claude setup and scanning source files |
| `create-snippet`    | Create a new snippet file in snippets/                           |
| `docs-sync`         | Sync project docs to reflect all changes since main              |
| `git-branch`        | Rename current branch to match conventional format               |
| `git-commit`        | Generate a conventional commit message from staged changes       |
| `git-pr`            | Generate a PR description and open a pull request                |
| `git-split`         | Split a mixed-commit branch into focused branches off main       |
| `git-stage`         | Batch-commit staged files grouped by concern                     |
| `release-changelog` | Generate a changelog entry from commits since main               |
| `git-ship`          | Run the full post-feature workflow in one sequence               |

Invoke with `/skill-name` or let Claude auto-trigger by matching against the skill description. See `standards/skill.md` for authoring conventions.

## CLI

| Command              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `aitk claude init`   | Seed `.claude/` workflow docs and `CLAUDE.md` into a project |
| `aitk claude sync`   | Diff managed role prompts against source and apply updates   |
| `aitk claude prompt` | Generate master prompts from installed governance rules      |
| `aitk claude gov`    | Build governance rules into `.claude/GOV.md`                 |

### init

Seeds `.claude/` with role prompt templates (`PLANNER.md`, `IMPLEMENTER.md`, `REVIEWER.md`) and state documents (`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `WIREFRAMES.md`). Also seeds `CLAUDE.md` at the project root and merges `.gitignore` entries. Skips files already present. Run once per project.

### sync

Diffs the three managed role prompts (`PLANNER.md`, `IMPLEMENTER.md`, `REVIEWER.md`) against the toolkit source and applies updates. Never touches seeded state documents. Offers a diff review before applying.

### prompt

Reads `PLANNER.md` and `IMPLEMENTER.md` from `.claude/`, injects context, and writes output to `.claude/.tmp/`. Also copies `REVIEWER.md` to `.claude/.tmp/`.

For `PLANNER.md`: injects `standards/prose.md`, planner governance rules from the `planner` stack, and context docs (`TASKS.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `WIREFRAMES.md`).

For `IMPLEMENTER.md`: injects all governance rules from `.cursor/rules/` and context docs (`TASKS.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

Prerequisites: run `aitk claude init` first, then `aitk gov install` to install rules for your stack.

### gov

Reads `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/`, strips frontmatter, concatenates them, and writes `.claude/GOV.md`. Claude Code loads this file automatically each session to provide governance context inline.

Prerequisites: run `aitk gov install` first to populate `.cursor/rules/`.
