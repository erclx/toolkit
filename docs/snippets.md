# Snippets system

## Overview

Snippets are small, reusable prompts invokable from Claude or Gemini chat via the Chrome extension using `slug:prompt` format. Each snippet is a focused plain markdown file with no frontmatter and no structure requirements.

## Structure

```plaintext
snippets/
├── *.md               ← invokable prompt snippets
└── snippets.toml      ← category definitions (slug lists)
docs/
└── snippets.md        ← this file
```

## Conventions

- Filename is the slug: `claude-edit.md` → invoked as `claude-edit`
- Kebab-case, no capitals, no underscores
- Plain markdown only, no YAML frontmatter
- One focused purpose per snippet; if it needs sections it's a system prompt, not a snippet
- Sync to the Chrome extension from `snippets/`

## Categories

Snippets are organized into categories in `snippets.toml`. Each category is a named list of slugs. There is no inheritance; categories are flat file lists.

| Category | Slugs                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base`   | chat-mode, senior-mode, claude-edit, session-notes, code-search |
| `claude` | claude-plan, code-review, claude-docs                           |

## Snippets

| Slug            | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat-mode`     | Session opener for tool behavior                    |
| `senior-mode`   | Senior-level judgment, discuss only                 |
| `claude-edit`   | Generate Claude Code edit prompt                    |
| `session-notes` | Capture session decisions                           |
| `code-search`   | Generate a git grep bash script                     |
| `claude-plan`   | Plan a feature, update `.claude/` docs when done    |
| `code-review`   | Adopt REVIEWER.md role, review changes against main |
| `claude-docs`   | Sync `.claude/` docs with session decisions         |

## CLI

| Command                                   | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `aitk snippets install [category] [path]` | Copy slugs for a category into a project, use `all` for everything |
| `aitk snippets sync [path]`               | Update snippets already present (never adds new)                   |
| `aitk snippets create`                    | Create a new snippet and register it in the TOML                   |

`aitk snippets` with no args shows a picker: `install`, `sync`, or `create`.

## Workflow

To install all snippets into a new project:

```bash
aitk snippets install all ../my-app
```

To install a specific category only:

```bash
aitk snippets install base ../my-app
aitk snippets install claude ../my-app
```

To sync updates to an existing project:

```bash
aitk snippets sync ../my-app
```

`sync` diffs all `.md` files already present in the target `snippets/` folder against the toolkit source. It is not category-aware, it only updates what is already there, never adds new files.

To create a new snippet:

```bash
aitk snippets create
# prompts for category (existing or new), then slug
# writes entry to snippets.toml and creates snippets/<slug>.md
```

## Adding a snippet

Use `aitk snippets create` — it handles both the TOML entry and the file. To add manually: create a `.md` file in `snippets/` using a kebab-case slug as the filename, then add the slug to the relevant category in `snippets.toml`.

## Adding a category

Use `aitk snippets create` and select `new category` when prompted. To add manually: append a new section to `snippets.toml`:

```toml
[my-category]
slugs = ["slug-one", "slug-two"]
```
