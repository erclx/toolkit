# Claude skill reference

## Overview

Skills provide Claude Code with domain-specific constraints and rules inline, so it can act immediately without reading all docs. Each skill body contains actionable rules for its domain. Full reference docs are the fallback for edge cases and deeper context. Skills use progressive disclosure: Claude reads only frontmatter at session start (~100 tokens each), matches a query against descriptions, then loads the full skill body.

## Structure

- Skill is a folder named in kebab-case containing `SKILL.md` (required), `scripts/` (optional), `references/` (optional), `assets/` (optional)
- `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters
- No `README.md` inside the skill folder
- No spaces, capitals, or underscores in folder or skill name

## Frontmatter

- `name` (required): kebab-case, matches folder name, no spaces or capitals
- `description` (required): what it does + when to use it, under 1024 chars, no XML tags
- `disable-model-invocation: true`: user-invoked only, Claude will not auto-trigger
- `allowed-tools`: restrict tool access when the skill is active
- `metadata`: optional key-value pairs (`author`, `version`, `mcp-server`)

## Description

- Structure: `[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key trigger phrases]`
- Include specific phrases users would say to trigger it
- Be specific, not vague. Claude routes based on this field alone.
- Add negative triggers if skill is over-triggering: `Do NOT use for X`

## Body

- Use imperative voice throughout
- Front-load critical instructions
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 5,000 words — move detailed docs to `references/`
- Link to `references/` files explicitly so Claude knows to load them
- Use progressive disclosure: `SKILL.md` for core instructions, `references/` for detail, `scripts/` for deterministic operations
- Headers: sentence case for all levels (H1, H2, H3)

## Scripts

- Use `scripts/` for operations that must be deterministic or repetitive
- Claude executes scripts and receives stdout — scripts are not loaded into context
- Use XML tags in script output for reliable parsing: `<SECTION>content</SECTION>`
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Always include `2>/dev/null || echo "FALLBACK"` guards on git and shell commands

## Invocation

- Skills auto-trigger when Claude matches the request against the description
- Invoke manually with `/skill-name` or `/<plugin>:skill-name` for plugin skills
- Plugin skills are namespaced: `plugin-name:skill-name`
- Priority order when names conflict: enterprise > personal > project > plugin

## Examples

### Correct

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for bugs, clarity, and standards compliance. Use when asking to review code, check a PR, or asking "does this look right".
---

# Code review

Before reviewing, read:

- `standards/code.md`: coding standards and conventions

## Guards

- If no file or diff is provided, stop: `❌ No code to review. Provide a file or diff.`

## Response format

- **Issues found:** <count>
- **Summary:** <one line>

List each issue with file, line, and suggested fix.
```

### Incorrect

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Handles all code-related tasks in scripts/, src/, and lib/. Also activate when user mentions bugs, refactoring, testing, linting, formatting, or any file ending in .ts .js .py .sh. # path-focused + keyword-stuffed
---

# Code review

A good code review should check for bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities,
code style, naming conventions, test coverage, documentation, error handling,
edge cases, and adherence to SOLID principles... # dumps everything inline instead of referencing standards
```
