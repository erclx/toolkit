# Wireframes

ASCII wireframes for planning purposes. Structure and layout only, not final design. Update this doc when a new surface is designed or a layout decision changes.

What belongs:

- ASCII diagrams showing layout, hierarchy, and component placement
- A context sentence per section describing when and where it appears
- All meaningful states: empty, loading, error, and any variant where the layout changes significantly
- Exact UI copy strings: labels, empty states, confirmation text, hints
- Interaction rules: what triggers what, navigation flow, confirmation behavior
- Intentional omissions with a brief reason, so they are not re-added later

What does not belong:

- Implementation details (event listeners, API call counts, storage keys). Those live in ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Visual decisions (colors, spacing, typography). Those live in DESIGN.md.
- Pixel values or final measurements. Verify those in the browser.

Use `←` for inline annotations inside diagrams. Use sentence case for all text labels. Document state variants as separate subsections when the layout changes. Keep behavior bullets to UX only: what the user sees and does, not how the code handles it.
