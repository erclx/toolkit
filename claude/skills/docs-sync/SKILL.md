name: docs-sync
description: Rewrites stale README.md and docs/*.md sections based on changes since main. Use before staging, or when asked to "sync docs" or "update the docs". Do NOT use for changelog updates or CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md updates.

# Docs sync

Before updating any docs, read:

- `standards/prose.md`: prose conventions for all generated text
- `standards/readme.md`: README structure, required sections, and content rules

Follow them exactly.

## Context

Run these commands in parallel:

- `git diff main..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)*.lock' ':(exclude)*-lock.json' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_DIFF"`
- `git diff --name-only main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_FILES"`
- `git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_STATUS"`

## Guards

- If `git diff main..HEAD` output is empty and `git status --short` output is empty, stop: `❌ No changes since main. Nothing to sync.`

## Discovery

Discover docs dynamically. Do not hardcode paths:

- Glob `README.md` at project root
- Glob `docs/**/*.md`

Read each discovered file.

## Analysis

For each discovered doc, classify as one of:

- `stale`: the diff touches something the doc describes
- `unrelated`: no overlap between diff and doc content

## Action

Rewrite only the stale sections. Do not touch sections unrelated to the diff. Write the updated file immediately after the preview. Claude Code's tool permission dialog is the confirmation gate. Do not wait for user input.

## Response format

### Preview

**Changes since main:** `<n>` files
**Docs discovered:** `<list>`

| Doc         | Status    | Action |
| ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| README.md   | stale     | update |
| docs/api.md | unrelated | skip   |

After outputting the preview, write all stale updates immediately.

### Summary

```
✅ Updated: <files written>
⏭️  Skipped: <files with no overlap>
```
