# AI sync

## Context

Run these commands in parallel:

- `git diff main..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)*.lock' ':(exclude)*-lock.json' 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_DIFF"`
- `git diff --name-status main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_FILES"`
- `git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_STATUS"`

## Guards

- If both `git diff main..HEAD` and `git status --short` are empty, stop: `❌ No changes. Nothing to review.`

## Discovery

Read these in parallel from the project root, skipping any that do not exist:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `GEMINI.md`

## Analysis

For each file found, determine whether the diff touches something it describes: key paths, commands, workflow conventions, skill names, or behavior rules. If there is no overlap, classify as unrelated and skip.

## Output

For each stale file, output specific suggested edits as a diff block. Do not rewrite the whole file. Target only the sections affected by the diff.

**`CLAUDE.md` suggested edit:**

```diff
- old line
+ new line
```

If no changes are needed, write: `✅ CLAUDE.md is up to date.`

Repeat for `GEMINI.md`.

Stop here. Apply suggestions manually.
