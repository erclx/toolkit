# Claude

## Internal skills

- Internal skills live in `.claude/skills/` and are toolkit-only, not installed into target projects.
- Each skill is a folder named in kebab-case containing `SKILL.md`.
- When updating an internal skill, write to `{base-dir}/SKILL.md` where `{base-dir}` is the path shown in the skill header at load time.

## Plugin skills

- Plugin skills live in `claude/skills/` and are auto-discovered when Claude Code loads with `--plugin-dir`. No registration needed, folder presence is enough.
- Each skill is a folder named in kebab-case containing `SKILL.md`.
- Read `docs/claude.md` before adding a skill. It lists all existing skills.
- Follow `standards/skill.md` for skill structure and frontmatter conventions.

## Sync checklist

When adding a new skill:

- Create the skill folder and `SKILL.md` in `claude/skills/`
- Add the skill to the skills table in `docs/claude.md`

When modifying a skill:

- Update the skills table in `docs/claude.md` if the description changed
