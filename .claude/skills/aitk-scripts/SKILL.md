# Scripts

## Entry points

- `manage-*.sh` files dispatch to subcommands only. No logic lives in entry points directly.
- Each `manage-*.sh` maps to one domain. Do not cross domains in a single entry point.

## Lib functions

- `lib/` contains shared functions sourced by scripts. Never duplicate logic that already exists there.
- Each lib file owns one concern. Read `docs/scripts.md` for responsibilities before adding or modifying.
- When adding a function to `lib/`, check if any existing script duplicates the logic and consolidate.

## Sandbox pattern

- Each sandbox defines three hooks: `use_config` (flags before provisioning), `use_anchor` (remote repo as base), `stage_setup` (scenario state after provisioning).
- Only `stage_setup` is required. End it with `log_step` describing what to run and what to expect.
- Default behavior: no standards, no gov rules, no Gemini settings, auto-commit on. Declare only the flags you need in `use_config`.

## Sync checklist

When adding a command to any `manage-*.sh`:

- Update the corresponding scenario list in `scripts/sandbox/infra/*.sh`
